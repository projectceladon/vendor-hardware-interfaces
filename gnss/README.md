## Overview: ##

The Android GNSS HAL (Global Navigation Satellite System Hardware Abstraction Layer)
serves as the interface between Android's framework and the GNSS hardware in a
device. It enables Android to interact with GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou, and
other satellite navigation systems, facilitating features like location tracking,
navigation, and time synchronization.
